## Fix Inventory

### FIX-001: DEFAULT `existing` weight reduction

**What changed:** DEFAULT profile `existing` weight reduced, redistributed to `ihr` and `ptmr`.

| Weight | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| `ihr` | 0.08 | 0.11 | +0.03 |
| `ptmr` | 0.07 | 0.10 | +0.03 |
| `existing` | 0.10 | 0.04 | -0.06 |

**Three-model consensus:** All three models independently identified `existing` as a legacy prominence metric with correlated overlap to MSD/spectral features. It inflated both probability AND confidence via the agreement list (double-counting). ChatGPT-CTX discovered the specific mechanism: existing contains MSD-flavored evidence, creating a correlated double-vote.

**Effective weight shift:** DEFAULT existing: 10.9% → 4.3% effective share (comb absent).

**Scenario scores after fix:**

| Scenario | Probability | Confidence | Verdict |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| DEFAULT FP — synth note | 0.680 | 0.628 | FEEDBACK |
| DEFAULT FN — reverberant feedback | 0.617 | 0.593 | POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK |
| CONSENSUS — with existing=0.9 | 0.703 | — | FEEDBACK |
| CONSENSUS — without existing (0.0) | 0.708 | — | FEEDBACK |

---

### FIX-002: MUSIC `existing` weight reduction

**What changed:** MUSIC profile `existing` slashed from 0.15 → 0.05. Redistributed to `ihr` (+0.09) and `ptmr` (+0.08), with `msd` also reduced (see FIX below).

| Weight | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| `msd` | 0.15 | 0.08 | -0.07 |
| `ihr` | 0.12 | 0.21 | +0.09 |
| `ptmr` | 0.05 | 0.13 | +0.08 |
| `existing` | 0.15 | 0.05 | -0.10 |

**Three-model consensus:** MUSIC `existing` at 16.3% effective share was the highest across all profiles. DAFx-16 paper reports 22% MSD accuracy on rock music — giving MSD 15% of the vote means it's wrong 78% of the time. Combined with `existing` double-counting, MUSIC mode had the worst false-positive exposure.

**Effective weight shift:** MUSIC existing: 16.3% → 5.4% effective share.

**Scenario scores after fix:**

| Scenario | Probability | Confidence | Verdict |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| MUSIC FP — guitar feedback | 0.704 | 0.651 | FEEDBACK |
| MUSIC FN — dense mix | 0.567 | 0.555 | POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK |
| GPT MUSIC FP — flanger | 0.681 | — | FEEDBACK |
| GPT MUSIC FN — cymbal mix | 0.451 | — | POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK |

### FIX-003: Comb included in confidence agreement list

**What changed:** `scores.comb.confidence` now participates in the `algorithmScoresList` used for confidence calculation (mean/std agreement) when comb pattern is active.

**Before:** Comb could flip probability from POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK → FEEDBACK via doubled weight, but confidence was unaware of the comb score. This created a confidence–probability asymmetry.

**After:** Comb score enters the agreement list when `hasPattern === true`, so confidence tracks the probability shift.

**Three-model consensus:** ChatGPT-CTX discovered this asymmetry — comb could shift the verdict without confidence being aware. All models agreed comb should participate symmetrically.

**Scenario scores after fix:**

| Scenario | Probability | Confidence | Verdict |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Comb flip — without comb | 0.591 | 0.591 | POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK |
| Comb flip — with comb | 0.622 | 0.613 | FEEDBACK |
| V7 — comb delta | — | — | delta=0.031 |
| Confidence diff | — | — | 0.022 (now tracked) |

### FIX-004: SPEECH `msd` weight reduction

**What changed:** SPEECH MSD reduced from 0.40 → 0.33. Redistributed to `phase` (+0.04) and `ptmr` (+0.06).

| Weight | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| `msd` | 0.40 | 0.33 | -0.07 |
| `phase` | 0.20 | 0.24 | +0.04 |
| `ihr` | 0.05 | 0.08 | +0.03 |
| `ptmr` | 0.10 | 0.16 | +0.06 |
| `existing` | 0.10 | 0.04 | -0.06 |

**Three-model consensus:** SPEECH MSD at 42.1% effective share was the single largest algorithm weight across all profiles. All three models found it could convict on its own:
- Gemini: sustained "Ummmm" scored 0.710 → FEEDBACK
- ChatGPT: "Wooooo!" scored 0.720 → FEEDBACK
- Claude: V3 MSD-only conviction reached FEEDBACK at prob=0.634

**Effective weight shift:** SPEECH MSD: 42.1% → 34.7% effective share.

**Scenario scores after fix:**

| Scenario | Before | After | Verdict Change |
|----------|--------|-------|----------------|
| V3 — MSD-only conviction | prob=0.634 | prob=0.579 | FEEDBACK → **POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK** ✅ |
| SPEECH FP — sustained vowel | — | 0.715 | FEEDBACK (still FP) |
| SPEECH FN — limiter-clamped | — | 0.618 | POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK |
| GPT SPEECH FP — shouting | — | 0.705 | FEEDBACK (still FP) |
| GPT-CTX SPEECH FP — MSD-only | — | 0.579 | **POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK** ✅ |

---

### FIX-005: COMPRESSED `phase` weight reduction

**What changed:** COMPRESSED phase reduced from 0.38 → 0.30. Redistributed to `spectral` (+0.03), `ihr` (+0.06), `ptmr` (+0.05).

| Weight | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| `phase` | 0.38 | 0.30 | -0.08 |
| `spectral` | 0.15 | 0.18 | +0.03 |
| `ihr` | 0.10 | 0.16 | +0.06 |
| `ptmr` | 0.07 | 0.12 | +0.05 |
| `existing` | 0.10 | 0.04 | -0.06 |

**Three-model consensus:** COMPRESSED phase at 41.3% effective share was a single-feature conviction risk:
- ChatGPT: Auto-Tuned vocal triggered phase-locked detection (prob=0.785)
- Gemini: pitch-corrected worship content false positive
- Claude: V8 phase conviction reached FEEDBACK at old weights

**Effective weight shift:** COMPRESSED phase: 41.3% → 32.6% effective share.

**Scenario scores after fix:**

| Scenario | Before | After | Verdict Change |
|----------|--------|-------|----------------|
| V8 — Phase conviction | prob>0.60 | prob=0.587 | FEEDBACK → **POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK** ✅ |
| COMPRESSED FN — pumping | missed | prob=0.617 | **Now detected** ✅ |
| GPT COMPRESSED FP — AutoTune | — | 0.785 | FEEDBACK (still FP) |
| GPT-CTX COMPRESS FP — phase-only | — | 0.587 | **POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK** ✅ |

### FIX-006: Multiplicative gates (IHR penalty + PTMR breadth)

**What changed:** Two post-fusion multiplicative gates added:

1. **IHR penalty gate:** If `ihr.isMusicLike === true` AND `harmonicsFound >= 3`, probability is multiplied by 0.65 (35% reduction). Converts IHR from a weak linear contributor to a discriminative veto.

2. **PTMR breadth gate:** If `ptmr.feedbackScore < 0.2` (very broad peak), probability is multiplied by 0.80 (20% reduction). Penalizes wide-spectrum energy.

**Three-model consensus:** ChatGPT proposed the multiplicative IHR gate concept. Gemini deep-think validated with acoustic reasoning: musical instruments have rich harmonic series; feedback is a singular tone. Both gates convert continuous-valued scores into step-function vetoes at extreme values.

**Scenario scores with gates:**

| Scenario | Without Gate | With Gate | Effect |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| GPT synth FP | 0.680 | 0.408 (gated) | Would drop to UNCERTAIN |
| DA-004 MSD-only feedback | 0.857 | 0.857 | No gate triggered (correct) |

---

## Additional Structural Changes

### Low-Frequency Phase Suppression (ADV-002)

Below 200 Hz, FFT phase resolution is too coarse for reliable coherence measurement. Phase influence is reduced by 50% via the new `peakFrequencyHz` parameter.

| Scenario | Normal | Low-Freq | Delta |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| 100 Hz feedback (DEFAULT) | 0.636 | 0.500 | -0.136 |
| 50 Hz feedback (MUSIC) | 0.690 | 0.500 | -0.190 |

### Existing removed from confidence agreement list

`existing` score no longer participates in the agreement-based confidence calculation, preventing correlated double-vote between probability and confidence.

| Scenario | High existing | Low existing |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Probability | 0.517 | 0.483 |
| Confidence | 0.517 | 0.483 |

### Comb doubling documentation

When acoustic comb pattern detected, comb weight doubles (0.08 → 0.16). Both numerator and denominator adjusted so `feedbackProbability` stays in [0,1]. Total weight becomes 1.08, diluting other algorithms by ~7.4%.

## Remaining Known Vulnerabilities (Not Fixed)

These are documented by the test suite but remain open — they represent fundamental architectural limitations:

| ID | Profile | Type | Score | Issue |
|----|---------|------|-------|-------|
| V1 | DEFAULT | FP | 0.663 | Synth note (MSD+Phase dominant) |
| V2 | DEFAULT | FN | 0.296 | Spectral-only feedback (MSD+Phase blind) |
| V4 | SPEECH | FN | 0.337 | No-MSD feedback invisible |
| V5 | MUSIC | FP | 0.704 | Phase-dominant music convicts |
| V6 | MUSIC | FN | 0.367 | No-phase feedback invisible |
| — | DEFAULT | FP | 0.722 | Alarm/siren near threshold |
| — | SPEECH | FP | 0.705 | Shouting presenter |
| — | COMPRESSED | FP | 0.785 | Auto-Tuned vocal |
| — | MUSIC | FP | 0.681 | Flanger/phaser pedal |

## Unexpected Regressions

**None discovered.** All fixes were verified to not worsen any existing test scenario:

- V3 (SPEECH MSD-only): **improved** from FEEDBACK → POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK (FIX-004)
- V8 (COMPRESSED phase): **improved** from FEEDBACK → POSSIBLE_FEEDBACK (FIX-005)
- COMPRESSED FN (pumping): **improved** from missed to detected (FIX-005)
- DA-004 (single strong MSD): still reaches FEEDBACK at 0.857 — no regression

The one test failure (`compressionDetection.test.ts` broad-peak flatness) is **pre-existing** on the base branch and unrelated to fusion weight changes.
